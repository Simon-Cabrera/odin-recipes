    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Whole Wheat Pancakes recipe a wholesome and hearty breakfast option that doesn't compromise on taste.
        Combining whole wheat flour with a touch of all-purpose flour and wheat germ, these pancakes achieve a light and tender texture.
        The inclusion of brown sugar adds a subtle sweetness, while buttermilk and eggs enrich the batter, resulting in flavorful and satisfying pancakes
   </p>
   <p>
    Preparation involves mixing the dry ingredients—whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, wheat germ, baking powder, baking soda, brown sugar, and salt—followed by incorporating small pieces of unsalted butter until the mixture resembles coarse sand.
     A well is then created in the center to add the buttermilk and beaten eggs, which are stirred until just combined. 
     Cooking the batter on a greased frying pan over medium heat allows the pancakes to develop a golden-brown exterior while remaining soft inside.
     Served warm, these pancakes pair excellently with maple syrup, making them a delightful choice for a nutritious breakfast.
