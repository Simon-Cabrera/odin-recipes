    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Braised Corned Beef Brisket recipe from Allrecipes offers a flavorful and tender alternative to the traditional boiled method. This approach involves searing a flat-cut corned beef brisket brushed with browning sauce to develop a rich crust. The brisket is then placed on a rack in a roasting pan, topped with sliced onions and garlic, and braised in a low-temperature oven for about six hours. This slow-cooking process allows the meat to become exceptionally tender and infused with savory flavors.</p>
    <p>To prepare, preheat your oven to 275°F (135°C). After discarding any flavoring packet from the corned beef, brush the brisket with browning sauce on both sides. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and brown the brisket on both sides, approximately 5 to 8 minutes per side. Place the seared brisket on a rack set in a roasting pan, scatter sliced onions and garlic over it, and add a small amount of water to the pan. Cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil and roast in the preheated oven until the meat is tender, about six hours. This method yields a corned beef brisket that is juicy, tender, and richly flavored, making it a delightful centerpiece for meals throughout the year.</p>
