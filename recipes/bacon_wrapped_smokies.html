        To prepare, preheat your oven to 325°F (165°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil for easy cleanup. Cut bacon slices into thirds, then wrap each piece around a cocktail wiener, securing it with a toothpick. Arrange the wrapped wieners on the prepared baking sheet and sprinkle them evenly with brown sugar. Bake in the preheated oven for about 40 minutes, or until the bacon is crisp and the sugar has melted into a bubbly glaze. These bite-sized treats can be served immediately or kept warm in a slow cooker, making them a convenient and crowd-pleasing option for parties and game-day events.
